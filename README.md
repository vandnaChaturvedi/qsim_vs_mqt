# Qiskit Simulator Comparison POC

This repository provides resources for a Proof of Concept (POC) involving two distinct Qiskit simulators.

## Contents

* **QASM Files:**
    * Two QASM files, representing the quantum circuits used in this POC.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    * `qasm_to_aer_sim_execute.ipynb`: Demonstrates the execution of the QASM circuits on Qiskit's AerSimulator, specifically using the QASM simulator method.
    * `qasm_to_qsim_easy.ipynb`: Showcases the execution of the QASM circuits on the Qiskit Qsim Density Matrix (DM) simulator.

## Purpose

This POC aims to compare and contrast the behavior and results obtained from Qiskit's AerSimulator (QASM simulator method) and Qiskit's Qsim DM simulator when running the provided quantum circuits.

## Notes

* Please refer to the individual Jupyter Notebooks for detailed explanations and code.
* The QASM files are provided for reference and can be modified or replaced as needed.
